77,2,Patient,Hi. I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm having a really hard time coping with it. I just can't seem to focus on anything.,emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
77,3,Therapist,I understand. PTSD can be very challenging to deal with. Can you tell me more about your symptoms and how they are affecting your life?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
77,4,Patient,"Well, I have trouble sleeping, I have nightmares, and I get easily triggered by things that remind me of my trauma. I also find it hard to concentrate and feel like my mind is always racing.",emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
77,5,Therapist,Those are all very common symptoms of PTSD. Have you tried any coping mechanisms or techniques to manage these symptoms?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
77,6,Patient,"I've tried deep breathing exercises and journaling, but they don't seem to help much.",failure_to_achieve,fear,,,
77,7,Therapist,"It's good that you are trying to manage your symptoms. Perhaps we can explore some other coping techniques together.

77,8,Patient,I'm open to anything that might help.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,

77,11,Therapist,"Okay, let's start by brainstorming some things that you can do when you feel triggered. Do you have any ideas?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
77,12,Patient,"I could call a friend, go for a walk, or listen to music.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
77,13,Therapist,"Those are all great ideas. Let's also add to the list, like doing some grounding exercises, like looking around the room and identifying different objects or taking deep breaths.",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
77,14,Patient,"Okay, I'll add those to my list.",dependence,neutral,,,
77,15,Therapist,"Great. And remember, it's important to practice these coping mechanisms when you are not feeling triggered as well, so that they become more automatic and easier to use when you do need them.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,elicit_change_talk
77,16,Patient,That makes sense.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
77,17,Therapist,Let's also work on building a support system for you. Who are some people in your life that you can talk to when you are feeling overwhelmed or triggered?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
77,18,Patient,I have a close friend and my sister.,negativity,surprise,,,
77,19,Therapist,That's great. It's important to have people who you can rely on for support. Let's also explore the idea of joining a support group for individuals with PTSD.

77,21,Therapist,"Yes, and if you are interested, I can help you find a support group in your area.",,,Positive,appropriate_self_disclosure,reflections
77,22,Patient,"Thank you, that would be great.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
77,23,Therapist,"Of course. And finally, let's also work on reframing negative thoughts and beliefs that you may have about yourself or your trauma. It's common for individuals with PTSD to feel guilty or ashamed, but it's important to remind yourself that it's not your fault and that you are not alone.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,values_and_strengths
77,24,Patient,"I do feel guilty sometimes, but I know logically that it wasn't my fault.",mistrust,sadness,,,
77,25,Therapist,That's a good start. Let's work on reinforcing that positive belief and challenging any negative thoughts that come up.,,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
77,26,Patient,"Okay, I'm willing to try that.",approval_seeking,sadness,,,
77,27,Therapist,"Great. Let's continue to work on coping mechanisms, building your support system, and reframing negative thoughts. And remember, you are not alone in this journey.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections

78,4,Patient,I've been having nightmares and flashbacks about the traumatic event that caused my PTSD. It's been hard to sleep and I've been feeling really on edge.,vulnerability,fear,,,
78,5,Therapist,That sounds really difficult. Have you been practicing any coping strategies we discussed during our last session?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

78,8,Patient,"Yes, I'm willing to try anything to feel better.",approval_seeking,fear,,,

78,10,Patient,It's been hard to connect with people. I feel like I'm always on guard and that makes it difficult to let my guard down and be myself.,emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
78,11,Therapist,That's a common experience for people with PTSD. Let's talk about how we can work on building your social skills and reducing anxiety in social situations. Have you considered joining a support group?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
78,12,Patient,"No, I haven't thought about that. Do you think it would help?",approval_seeking,fear,,,

78,17,Therapist,"I understand that can be frustrating. Let's talk about strategies to improve your focus and productivity. Have you tried making a to-do list or breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
78,18,Patient,"I've tried making a to-do list before, but I never seem to be able to stick to it.",punitiveness,neutral,,,
78,19,Therapist,"That's okay, we can work on developing a more realistic plan. It's important to set goals that are achievable and to celebrate progress along the way.

78,22,Patient,I feel like I'm always on high alert and that makes it hard to feel safe in new situations.,vulnerability,neutral,,,
78,23,Therapist,"I understand. Let's talk about ways to gradually expose yourself to new experiences in a safe and controlled way. We can start with something small, like trying a new food or taking a different route home. Would you be willing to try that?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
78,24,Patient,"Yes, I think I can do that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
78,25,Therapist,"Great, let's check in next week and see how you're progressing with your social skills, productivity, and openness to new experiences. And as always, please reach out if you need additional support between sessions.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections

79,8,Patient,"Yes, definitely.",approval_seeking,sadness,,,
79,9,Therapist,Great. Let's start by exploring some relaxation techniques. Have you ever tried progressive muscle relaxation?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
79,10,Patient,"No, I haven't.",defectiveness,neutral,,,
79,11,Therapist,"It involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups, and can be helpful for reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation. Let's try it together.",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

79,14,Therapist,"That's great to hear. Now, let's talk about some coping strategies you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed by your symptoms. Have you tried grounding techniques?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
79,15,Patient,"No, I haven't.",defectiveness,surprise,,,
79,16,Therapist,"Grounding techniques involve using your senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. For example, you can focus on the feel of your breath, the sights around you, or the sounds in the room. Would you like to try it now?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
79,17,Patient,Sure.,approval_seeking,surprise,,,
79,18,Therapist,How are you feeling now?,,,Positive,active_listening,values_and_strengths
79,19,Patient,"More centered, I think.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
79,20,Therapist,"That's great. Now, let's talk about some longer-term strategies for managing your symptoms. Have you considered therapy or medication?",,,Positive,asking_empowering_questions,open_questions
79,21,Patient,"I've tried therapy before, but it hasn't been very effective. And I'm hesitant to try medication because of the side effects.",mistrust,fear,,,
79,22,Therapist,"I understand your concerns. Therapy can be a process, and sometimes it takes time to find the right approach that works for you. And medication is not for everyone. There are also alternative treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, that might be helpful for you. Would you be open to exploring those options?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
79,23,Patient,I'm willing to give it a try.,approval_seeking,fear,,,
79,24,Therapist,"Great. I'll send you some resources to look into, and we can discuss it more in our next session.",,,Positive,appropriate_self_disclosure,values_and_strengths

82,8,Patient,"No, I haven't. Can you tell me more about those techniques?",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
82,9,Therapist,"Sure. Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. Guided imagery is a relaxation technique that involves visualizing a peaceful and calming scene or experience.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
82,10,Patient,That sounds interesting. I'll give it a try.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
82,11,Therapist,"Great. In addition to relaxation techniques, have you been practicing any self-care activities?",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions

82,14,Patient,I used to enjoy painting but haven't had much time for it lately.,negativity,neutral,,,
82,15,Therapist,That's a great idea. Carving out time for activities that you enjoy can help reduce stress and improve your overall mood. Let's work on scheduling in some self-care time into your daily routine.,,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
82,16,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

83,6,Patient,"Yeah, I've been trying deep breathing exercises and going for walks when I can. But it's still tough.",vulnerability,fear,,,
83,7,Therapist,"It can be a challenge, but keep at it. It's important to find things that work for you. Have you been engaging in any activities that you enjoy lately?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
83,8,Patient,I've been trying to get out more and socialize with friends when I can. It helps take my mind off things.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,

87,14,Patient,That helped me feel more relaxed.,vulnerability,neutral,,,

211,4,Patient,I don't really know. It's just this constant feeling of worry and fear.,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,

216,18,Patient,"A little calmer, I guess.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
216,19,Therapist,"That's a good start. Let's try practicing this technique a few times a day, especially when you feel your anxiety starting to increase. In addition, I'd like to work on some cognitive-behavioral techniques to help you challenge and reframe any negative thoughts you may have.",,,Positive,active_listening,elicit_change_talk

219,4,Patient,It's mostly related to work. I've been taking on a lot of projects and deadlines and it's starting to feel overwhelming.,entitlement,fear,,,
219,5,Therapist,That sounds like a lot of pressure. Have you tried talking to your boss or coworkers about delegating some of the work?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
219,6,Patient,"No, I haven't. I don't want to come across as incompetent or unable to handle my responsibilities.",dependence,fear,,,

219,16,Patient,Not really. I've been staying up late trying to finish work and haven't had time for the gym.,dependence,neutral,,,

219,18,Patient,That makes sense. I'll try to prioritize those things more.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,

232,14,Patient,"My relationships have been okay, but I've been avoiding some of my friends and family because of my anxiety.",negativity,neutral,,,
232,15,Therapist,"It's understandable to want to avoid stressful situations, but isolating yourself can make things worse. Would you be willing to try to reach out to someone you trust and talk to them about how you're feeling?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
232,16,Patient,I'm not sure. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.,vulnerability,neutral,,,
232,17,Therapist,"It's important to remember that reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Your friends and family care about you and would want to support you. Let's work on building your confidence to reach out to them.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
232,18,Patient,"Okay, that sounds like a good idea.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
232,19,Therapist,"Let's also talk about setting some realistic goals for yourself, both in your personal and professional life. It's important to have things to work towards, but it's also important to not overwhelm yourself.",,,Negative,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
232,20,Patient,"That makes sense. I think I need to learn how to say ""no"" more often and prioritize my own needs.",dependence,neutral,,,
232,21,Therapist,"Exactly. Remember, taking care of yourself is important too. Let's work on some assertiveness techniques to help you feel more comfortable setting boundaries with others.",,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
232,22,Patient,"Okay, that sounds like it could be helpful.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
232,23,Therapist,"Great, we can work on that together in our next session. Before we end today's session, is there anything else you wanted to talk about?",,,Off-record,active_listening,open_questions
232,24,Patient,"No, I think that's all for today. Thank you for your help.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

236,3,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. What specifically are you feeling worried about?,,,Off-record,active_listening,open_questions
236,4,Patient,"I'm not sure, it's just this general feeling of unease that I can't seem to shake.",vulnerability,fear,,,
236,5,Therapist,That's understandable. Have you tried any relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
236,6,Patient,"Yes, but they haven't been working as well as they used to.",dependence,fear,,,
236,7,Therapist,I see. Maybe we can explore some new techniques together. How do you feel about that?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
236,8,Patient,That sounds good to me.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
236,9,Therapist,Great. Let's start by discussing some of the things that may be causing your anxiety.,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
236,10,Patient,"Well, I've been having some health issues and I'm worried about what they could mean.",vulnerability,fear,,,

236,17,Therapist,Good. Let's begin by identifying some of the negative thoughts you've been having recently.,,,Negative,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
236,18,Patient,"Well, I've been thinking a lot about how my health issues could be serious and how I might not be able to handle them.",emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
236,19,Therapist,"Okay, that's a common worry for many people. Let's try to challenge that thought by looking at the evidence. Have you talked to a doctor or a specialist about your health concerns?",,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
236,20,Patient,"Yes, I have.",approval_seeking,fear,,,
236,21,Therapist,And what did they say?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
236,22,Patient,"They said that it could be a number of things, but they are running some tests to find out for sure.",mistrust,fear,,,
236,23,Therapist,That's good news. It means that you're taking the right steps to address your concerns. Let's try to focus on that evidence and challenge the negative thought that your health issues could be serious.,,,Off-record,active_listening,reflections
236,24,Patient,"Okay, I can try to do that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
236,25,Therapist,"Good. Remember, it takes time and practice to change negative thought patterns, but it's worth it in the long run. Let's continue working on this in our next session.",,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
236,26,Patient,"Thank you, I appreciate your help.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

238,2,Patient,"Hi, I'm feeling quite anxious today. My heart is racing, and I'm having trouble focusing.",emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
238,3,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. Let's start by taking a few deep breaths together. (pause for breathing) Can you tell me more about what might have triggered your anxiety today?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
238,4,Patient,"Well, I have a lot of social events coming up, and I feel overwhelmed by the idea of having to interact with so many people.",insufficient_selfcontrol,fear,,,
238,5,Therapist,That sounds like it could be quite challenging. How do you typically cope with social situations?,,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
238,6,Patient,I usually try to avoid them or make excuses not to go. But that's not really a long-term solution.,mistrust,surprise,,,
238,7,Therapist,"You're right, avoidance can only work for so long. Have you tried any other strategies in the past?",,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
238,8,Patient,"Not really, I don't know what else to do.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,9,Therapist,That's understandable. Would you be open to exploring some new coping strategies together?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
238,10,Patient,"Yes, I would appreciate that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,11,Therapist,"Great. One approach we could try is cognitive-behavioral therapy, where we work to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that might be contributing to your anxiety. Another approach is exposure therapy, where we gradually expose you to social situations in a safe and controlled environment. How do those sound to you?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
238,12,Patient,I'm willing to try anything that might help.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,13,Therapist,That's a great attitude to have. Let's start by exploring some of those negative thoughts you mentioned earlier. Can you tell me more about them?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
238,14,Patient,"Well, I often think that people are judging me and that I'm not good enough to be around them.",mistrust,neutral,,,
238,15,Therapist,Those are common negative thoughts that can contribute to anxiety. Let's work together to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that people are judging you?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
238,16,Patient,"I don't really have any evidence, it's just a feeling I get.",emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
238,17,Therapist,"Exactly, it's just a feeling. And feelings can be deceptive. Let's try to identify some more realistic and positive thoughts that might help you feel more confident in social situations. Can you think of any?",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
238,18,Patient,"I guess I could remind myself that I am worthy of love and respect, just like everyone else.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,19,Therapist,That's a great thought to focus on. And what about the idea that you're not good enough to be around people? Is there any evidence to support that thought?,,,Negative,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
238,20,Patient,"No, not really.",defectiveness,neutral,,,
238,21,Therapist,"Exactly. In fact, I bet there are many people who appreciate your company and value your presence. Let's work on challenging those negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive ones.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
238,22,Patient,"Okay, I'm willing to try.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,23,Therapist,"Great. And in the meantime, let's also work on some relaxation techniques to help you manage your anxiety. How does that sound?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
238,24,Patient,That sounds good. What kinds of techniques do you recommend?,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,25,Therapist,"Well, some people find deep breathing exercises helpful, while others prefer meditation or visualization. We can explore different options and see what works best for you.",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
238,26,Patient,"Okay, I'm open to that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
238,27,Therapist,"Great. And remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. We don't need to rush into anything too quickly. How about we end this session with a breathing exercise together?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

245,4,Patient,I have a lot of flashbacks and nightmares. I also get really anxious and jumpy in certain situations.,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
245,5,Therapist,That sounds really tough. Have you tried any coping mechanisms or techniques to help manage these symptoms?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
245,6,Patient,"Not really. I've been avoiding situations that trigger my symptoms, but it's becoming more difficult to avoid them.",vulnerability,fear,,,
245,7,Therapist,Avoidance can actually worsen PTSD symptoms in the long run. Have you considered trying exposure therapy?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
245,8,Patient,"No, I haven't. What is that?",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
245,9,Therapist,"Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing yourself to the triggering situations or memories, in a controlled and safe environment. This can help desensitize your reactions over time.",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
245,10,Patient,That sounds scary.,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
245,11,Therapist,"It can be challenging, but I will be there to support you every step of the way. We can go at your own pace and make sure you feel comfortable throughout the process.",,,Positive,active_listening,reflections

248,4,Patient,"I have nightmares, flashbacks, and I'm always on edge. I can't relax, and I feel like I'm always in danger.",vulnerability,fear,,,

248,6,Patient,"I've tried deep breathing and mindfulness, but they don't seem to work.",unrelenting_standards,fear,,,

248,20,Patient,"No, I haven't. What should I do?",approval_seeking,fear,,,

250,16,Patient,"Well, I was sitting in my own home, and there was no actual danger present.",negativity,neutral,,,

250,18,Patient,"It feels reassuring, but also a bit hard to believe in the moment.",approval_seeking,joy,,,
250,19,Therapist,"That's understandable. It can take some time to retrain our brains to think differently. Let's keep practicing this technique in future sessions, and also explore some other coping mechanisms that might work better for you.

250,20,Patient,That sounds good. I appreciate your help.,enmeshment,joy,,,

311,3,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's been causing these feelings?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
311,4,Patient,I've been having trouble distinguishing reality from my own thoughts. Sometimes I get lost in my own mind and it's hard to come back.,emotional_deprivation,surprise,,,

311,6,Patient,"Yes, but I feel like it's not enough sometimes.",vulnerability,sadness,,,

311,14,Patient,A little bit calmer.,emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
311,15,Therapist,"That's a good start. Let's also work on some cognitive-behavioral techniques to challenge negative thought patterns that may be contributing to your anxiety. For example, when you have a thought like ""I'm losing touch with reality"", try to ask yourself if there's any evidence to support that thought. What evidence is there that you are still in touch with reality?",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
311,16,Patient,I guess there's no real evidence that I'm not in touch with reality. It's just a feeling.,mistrust,neutral,,,
311,17,Therapist,"Right. It's important to challenge these negative thoughts and replace them with more balanced, rational thoughts. Let's also work on building a support system for you. Do you have any friends or family members you feel comfortable talking to about your struggles?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
311,18,Patient,Not really. I've always kept my struggles to myself.,emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,

311,20,Patient,"No, I haven't.",defectiveness,neutral,,,
311,21,Therapist,That might be a good place to start. Support groups can be a great way to connect with others who are going through similar experiences and find a sense of community.,,,Positive,appropriate_self_disclosure,reflections

311,26,Patient,"Okay, I'll try that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
311,27,Therapist,"Lastly, it's important to have a plan in place for when you're feeling overwhelmed or in crisis. Do you have a crisis plan that you've developed with your doctor or therapist?",,,Negative,unconditional_positive_regard,values_and_strengths
311,28,Patient,"No, I don't.",defectiveness,surprise,,,

313,5,Therapist,"I see. It's important to have a social support network, but it's also important to make sure you're taking care of yourself. Have you talked to your doctor about medication or therapy to manage your symptoms?",,,Negative,active_listening,elicit_change_talk
313,6,Patient,"Yes, I'm on medication and I see a therapist regularly.",dependence,neutral,,,
313,7,Therapist,That's great to hear. Have you talked to your therapist about your desire to be more social?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
313,8,Patient,"Not yet, I wanted to bring it up with you first.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
313,9,Therapist,"Of course, it's important to talk about these things. Let's explore why you might be feeling more social lately. Is there anything in particular that's been triggering this desire?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
313,10,Patient,"I'm not sure, maybe it's just the change in the weather. Spring always makes me feel more energized and motivated.",abandonment,joy,,,
313,11,Therapist,"That's a possibility. It's also possible that you're feeling more stable and comfortable with your symptoms, which is allowing you to feel more social.",,,Positive,perspective_taking,reflections
313,12,Patient,That's true. I've been feeling more in control lately.,vulnerability,joy,,,
313,13,Therapist,That's great progress. Let's work on finding a balance between your social life and your self-care. Have you tried setting limits for yourself when it comes to socializing?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
313,14,Patient,"Not really, I tend to go with the flow.",mistrust,neutral,,,
313,15,Therapist,"It might be helpful to set some boundaries for yourself. For example, you could plan to socialize for a certain amount of time each week and make sure you're also taking time for self-care activities.",,,Off-record,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
313,16,Patient,"Okay, I can try that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

313,18,Patient,That's good advice. Thank you.,approval_seeking,fear,,,

313,20,Patient,"Yes, I do sometimes.",approval_seeking,fear,,,

313,22,Patient,I like that.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
313,23,Therapist,"Lastly, let's work on building your confidence in social situations. What are some things that you feel confident about when it comes to socializing?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
313,24,Patient,I'm good at listening and making people feel comfortable.,social_isolation,neutral,,,

315,4,Patient,"No, it's just a general feeling of unease.",emotional_deprivation,fear,,,

315,6,Patient,"I've tried deep breathing, but I'm not very good at it.",emotional_deprivation,fear,,,

It can help you build awareness of your patterns of thinking and feeling, and develop more positive coping strategies.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
315,12,Patient,That sounds interesting. How do we practice mindfulness?,approval_seeking,fear,,,
315,13,Therapist,"There are many ways to practice mindfulness, such as meditation, breathing exercises, or simply paying attention to your senses. Let's start with a short meditation exercise.

329,6,Patient,"Yes, I've tried some deep breathing and meditation, but it hasn't really helped.",negativity,fear,,,

329,8,Patient,"Sure, that sounds like it could be helpful.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
329,9,Therapist,"Great, let's start by identifying some of those negative thoughts you've been having. Can you tell me about a recent situation that triggered your anxiety?",,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions

330,10,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
330,11,Therapist,"One technique that might be helpful is cognitive-behavioral therapy, where we work on identifying and changing negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety. Another technique is progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and release different muscle groups in your body to reduce tension.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
330,12,Patient,Those both sound interesting. How do they work?,emotional_inhibition,neutral,,,
330,13,Therapist,"With cognitive-behavioral therapy, we would work on identifying the specific thoughts that are causing you anxiety and then try to challenge and replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts. With progressive muscle relaxation, you focus on tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body, which can help release tension and reduce anxiety.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
330,14,Patient,That makes sense. I think I'd be willing to try both of those techniques.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
330,15,Therapist,"Great, we can definitely work on those in our future sessions. In the meantime, is there anything else that's been causing you stress or anxiety?",,,Off-record,active_listening,open_questions

330,20,Patient,"I haven't, but maybe I should.",approval_seeking,sadness,,,

508,5,Therapist,I understand that can be a scary feeling. Can you tell me more about what you mean by losing touch with reality?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
508,6,Patient,It's like my thoughts and feelings don't match up with what's happening around me. I hear voices and see things that aren't there. It's hard to explain.,mistrust,fear,,,
508,7,Therapist,I see. That must be very distressing. How have you been coping with these experiences?,,,Positive,active_listening,reflections
508,8,Patient,"I've been trying to ignore them or distract myself, but it's been getting harder to do that.",emotional_deprivation,fear,,,

508,17,Therapist,"Sure. Grounding techniques can help you feel more present in the moment and connected to your surroundings. Some examples include focusing on your breath, engaging your senses by noticing what you can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch, or using a calming mantra or phrase to repeat to yourself. Mindfulness exercises can also help you cultivate a non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.",,,Positive,holding_space_for_emotions,open_questions
508,18,Patient,That sounds helpful. I'll give it a try.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,

508,21,Therapist,That's understandable. It can be hard to open up to others when you're going through something like this. Have you considered joining a support group or seeking out others who have similar experiences?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
508,22,Patient,"No, I haven't thought about that. Do you think it would help?",approval_seeking,fear,,,

894,4,Patient,It's just been hard to feel motivated and happy. I don't really see the point in anything anymore.,emotional_deprivation,sadness,,,

894,10,Patient,Not really. I've been feeling too down to want to be around people.,emotional_deprivation,joy,,,
894,11,Therapist," I understand. It can be hard to reach out to others when you're feeling depressed. Would you be open to trying to connect with loved ones again, even if it's just for a short period of time?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
894,12,Patient," I could try, I guess.",approval_seeking,sadness,,,

895,4,Patient,It just feels like everything is overwhelming and I can't seem to find joy in anything anymore.,emotional_deprivation,sadness,,,

895,6,Patient," Okay, that sounds good.",approval_seeking,sadness,,,
895,7,Therapist,One thing we could try is journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be really helpful in processing them.,,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
895,8,Patient," I've never tried that before, but I'm willing to give it a shot.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

895,10,Patient," Okay, I've heard of that before. How do I do it?",approval_seeking,neutral,,,

895,20,Patient,How do I do that?,approval_seeking,neutral,,,

Then we can work on coming up with more balanced and realistic thoughts to replace them.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,elicit_change_talk
895,22,Patient," Okay, that sounds like a good approach.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
895,23,Therapist," Now, I also want to make sure we're addressing any underlying issues that might be contributing to your depression. Are there any past traumas or difficult experiences that might be affecting you?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

897,4,Patient,I just feel really down and unmotivated most days. It's hard to find joy in anything.,emotional_deprivation,sadness,,,
897,5,Therapist,That sounds really tough. Can you tell me what seems to trigger these feelings?,,,Negative,active_listening,reflections
897,6,Patient," Sometimes it's just random, but other times it's when I feel like I've failed at something or let someone down.",failure_to_achieve,sadness,,,
897,7,Therapist,I see. Have you tried any coping mechanisms or strategies to help manage these feelings?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

897,12,Patient,That sounds helpful.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
897,13,Therapist," Great, let's get started. One thing that may be helpful is identifying some positive things in your life. Can you think of anything that brings you happiness or fulfillment?",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
897,14,Patient,I guess spending time with my dog and my family.,self_sacrifice,neutral,,,
897,15,Therapist," That's a great start. It's important to focus on those positive things, even when it feels difficult. How about we try setting some small goals for yourself to work towards?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

897,23,Therapist,Fantastic. And how about we also work on some strategies to challenge negative thoughts when they come up? Does that sound helpful?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
897,24,Patient," Yes, that would be helpful.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
897,25,Therapist," Alright, let's try a technique called cognitive restructuring.

Then, try to reframe the thought in a more positive or realistic way.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,elicit_change_talk
897,26,Patient," Okay, I'll try that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
897,27,Therapist," Great. Remember, it's important to be gentle with yourself and not judge yourself too harshly. It takes time to make progress, but with persistence, it's definitely achievable.",,,Positive,validation,reflections

901,8,Patient,I'm open to trying anything that will help me feel better.,approval_seeking,joy,,,

901,10,Patient,I don't really know. It's just this constant feeling of sadness and emptiness.,emotional_deprivation,sadness,,,

901,13,Therapist,Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts or behaviors that might be contributing to your sadness?,,,Positive,asking_empowering_questions,open_questions
901,14,Patient," Well, I tend to isolate myself a lot. I don't really feel like talking to anyone or doing anything.",self_sacrifice,sadness,,,
901,15,Therapist,Is there anything you used to enjoy that you've stopped doing?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
901,16,Patient," Yeah, I used to love painting and going for walks, but I haven't done either in months.",abandonment,sadness,,,

901,18,Patient," Okay, I can try that.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
901,19,Therapist," Great. And in the meantime, let's also explore some coping strategies for when you're feeling really low. Have you tried any breathing exercises or meditation?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions

902,10,Patient," Okay, I'll give it a try. But I'm worried about the cost.",mistrust,fear,,,

902,19,Therapist," It's possible that therapy may not be the right fit for everyone. But it's important to give it a chance and explore different approaches.

902,20,Patient,That makes sense. But what if I feel overwhelmed during therapy?,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
902,21,Therapist," It's common to feel overwhelmed during therapy. It's a space where you may be exploring difficult emotions and experiences.

926,16,Patient,I can try.,approval_seeking,joy,,,

934,8,Patient," No, I haven't. What are grounding techniques?",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
934,9,Therapist,Grounding techniques are ways to help you stay in the present moment and focus on your surroundings. They can include things like deep breathing exercises or sensory stimulation. Would you be interested in learning some techniques to help with that?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
934,10,Patient," Yes, I would.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
934,11,Therapist,Great. Let's start with a deep breathing exercise. Take a deep breath in through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Let's do that a few more times.,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
934,12,Patient,Okay.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
934,13,Therapist," Good. Now, I want you to look around the room and name five things you can see.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,elicit_provide_elicit

Would you be open to exploring those things in future sessions?,,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
934,24,Patient," Yes, I would be open to that.",approval_seeking,joy,,,

936,11,Therapist,Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups in your body to help you release tension and promote relaxation.

936,12,Patient," Sure, I'm willing to try anything.",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
936,13,Therapist," Great. Let's start with progressive muscle relaxation. I'll guide you through the process, and you can follow along with my instructions. First, I want you to tense up your shoulders and hold the tension for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and let your shoulders relax. Good job. Now let's move on to your arms. Tense up your biceps and hold the tension for a few seconds. Then, release the tension and let your arms relax. Keep following my instructions, and we'll work our way through all the muscle groups in your body.",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
936,14,Patient,That feels really good. I'm already starting to feel more relaxed.,vulnerability,neutral,,,
936,15,Therapist," That's great to hear. Now let's try guided imagery. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

937,3,Therapist,I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk more about what's been causing your anxiety?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
937,4,Patient," It's just been a combination of things, like work stress and some family issues.",vulnerability,fear,,,

937,7,Therapist," I see. Well, let's work together to find some coping strategies that work better for you. With your personality trait of extraversion, you may benefit from social support and connection. Have you considered joining a support group or talking to friends or family about your experiences with PTSD?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
937,8,Patient,I haven't really thought about that. I guess I've been hesitant to talk to people about it.,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
937,9,Therapist," It's understandable to feel hesitant or vulnerable about opening up, but having a support system can be really beneficial for managing PTSD. Another strategy that may be helpful for you is physical exercise, as it can release endorphins and reduce stress. Have you tried any physical activity, like running or yoga?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
937,10,Patient," I used to play sports in high school, but I haven't been very active lately. Maybe I should try to get back into it.",approval_seeking,fear,,,

We can also work on some relaxation techniques, like progressive muscle relaxation or visualization exercises, to help you manage your anxiety.",,,Positive,active_listening,values_and_strengths
937,12,Patient," Yeah, that sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that could help.",approval_seeking,fear,,,

937,14,Patient," Okay, I'm open to that. How do we get started?",approval_seeking,neutral,,,
937,15,Therapist," We can start by identifying some specific stressors that are causing you the most anxiety. Then, we can work on developing strategies to cope with those stressors, like time management or assertiveness skills. It's important to remember that managing PTSD is a process, and it can take time to find what works best for you. But with patience and persistence, we can make progress together.",,,Off-record,active_listening,open_questions

943,5,Therapist,I see. How has this been affecting your daily life?,,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
943,6,Patient," It's been hard to focus at work, and I've been having trouble sleeping. I feel like I'm always on edge, and it's hard to relax.",vulnerability,fear,,,
943,7,Therapist,I understand. We'll work on finding ways to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Have you tried any coping strategies before?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
943,8,Patient," I've tried deep breathing exercises and meditation, but they don't seem to help much. I also try to distract myself by doing activities I enjoy.",approval_seeking,fear,,,
943,9,Therapist," Those are good strategies, but sometimes it takes a combination of techniques to find what works best for you. We'll explore different coping mechanisms and find what helps you feel more at ease.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
943,10,Patient,That sounds good.,approval_seeking,neutral,,,
943,11,Therapist,Let's start by talking about your triggers. What situations or experiences tend to trigger your PTSD symptoms?,,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
943,12,Patient," Certain smells or sounds can trigger flashbacks, and sometimes even seeing certain objects can bring back memories.",emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
943,13,Therapist," I see. It can be difficult to avoid all triggers, but we can work on ways to manage your reactions when you are triggered. Would you be open to exploring exposure therapy as a potential coping mechanism?",,,Positive,active_listening,open_questions
943,14,Patient,I'm not sure. It sounds scary.,emotional_deprivation,fear,,,
943,15,Therapist," It can be intimidating, but it can also be very effective in helping to desensitize you to your triggers. We'll take things at a pace that you're comfortable with and make sure you feel safe throughout the process.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,reflections
943,16,Patient," Okay, I'm willing to give it a try.",approval_seeking,fear,,,
943,17,Therapist,Great. We'll also work on developing relaxation techniques that you can use when you're feeling anxious or stressed. We can start with progressive muscle relaxation or visualization exercises.,,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,open_questions
943,18,Patient,That sounds helpful.,approval_seeking,fear,,,
943,19,Therapist," In addition to coping mechanisms, it can also be helpful to work on changing your negative thought patterns. Have you noticed any negative self-talk or thought patterns related to your PTSD?",,,Negative,active_listening,open_questions
943,20,Patient," Yeah, sometimes I blame myself for what happened, or I feel like I'm weak for not being able to cope.",vulnerability,fear,,,
943,21,Therapist," Those are common thoughts among people with PTSD, but it's important to remember that they are not true. We'll work on changing those negative thought patterns and developing more positive and realistic self-talk.",,,Positive,unconditional_positive_regard,elicit_change_talk

944,8,Patient," I don't know much about those therapies, can you explain more?",approval_seeking,fear,,,

Notice any tension or discomfort and try to relax those areas. Now, bring your attention to your breath and observe it without trying to change it. Just notice the inhale and exhale. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your breath. Let's try this for a minute or two.",,,Positive,active_listening,summarizing

1006,10,Patient," No, I haven't. What is that?",defectiveness,neutral,,,

1006,18,Patient," I've tried journaling, but it's hard for me to put my thoughts into words sometimes. And I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff.",emotional_deprivation,neutral,,,
1006,19,Therapist," I understand. It can be difficult to find the right words to express what we're feeling.
